For estimation of fractal dimension, we extend the fractal Brownian function approach to accommodate irregularly sampled data, and we develop methods for segmenting sets of points exhibiting self-similarity over only certain scales. For fractal surface reconstruction, we extend Szeliski's regularization with fractal priors method to use a temperature parameter that depends on fractal dimension. We demonstrate both estimation and reconstruction with noisy range imagery of natural terrain.},

abstract = {We present an algorithm mainly designed to reconstruct Digital Elevation Maps (DEM). Our approach relays on a fast and highly controllable fractal-based algorithm, we are able to create DEMs according to given constraints. Thus, these constraints can be given as scattered dataset of elevations obtained by satellite, our method supersamples this data and creates the according smooth terrain surface. Moreover, as a painter can make a sketch of his model, the final user can give or edit the main characteristics, local details and morphology, of his wanted DEM instantaneously obtaining the resulting terrain surface. Note that there is no limitation on the number of local constraints (that could vary from 0 to the number of points of the final DEM). Thus, the method we propose gives the ability to modify the global aspect (the surface behavior) as well as to constrain any local detail of the final terrain model. This paper presents the algorithm and reconstruction examples. Using a Root Mean Square Error computation between an original model and its downsampled-then-reconstructed version, the results confirm the method good behavior and show its efficiency. Other various terrain models and alternative applications are presented.},

In this paper, we describe a three-steps method that produces a terrain mesh using ridge lines and rivers drainage network. As opposed to previous methods that compute water erosion for a given terrain model --- Digital Elevation Map ---, our terrain mesh is generated constrained by a precomputed set of ridge lines and rivers network. A skeleton of a ridges and rivers network is computed and stored in a Digital Elevation Map (D.E.M.) as initial values. Then, the elevations data set is enriched using a novel interpolation method based on a Midpoint Displacement's Inverse process. Finally, a midpoint displacement subdivision is applied to interpolate the remaining elevation coordinates. The resulting terrain meshes lead to naturalistic landscape models and our method seems to be very promising. Images produced by our model are presented.},

abstract = {In the production of computer generated pictures of three dimensional objects, one stage of the calculation is the determination of the intensity of a given object once its visibility has been established. This is typically done by modelling the surface as a perfect diffuser, sometimes with a specular component added for the simulation of hilights. This paper presents a more accurate function for the generation of hilights which is based on some experimental measurements of how light reflects from real surfaces. It differs from previous models in that the intensity of the hilight changes with the direction of the light source. Also the position and shape of the hilights is somewhat different from that generated by simpler models. Finally, the hilight function generates different results when simulating metallic vs. nonmetallic surfaces. Many of the effects so generated are somewhat subtle and are apparent only during movie sequences. Some representative still frames from such movies are included.},

abstract = {Computer generated shaded images have reached an impressive degree of realism with the current state of the art. They are not so realistic, however, that they would fool many people into believing they are real. One problem is that the surfaces tend to look artificial due to their extreme smoothness. What is needed is a means of simulating the surface irregularities that are on real surfaces. In 1973 Ed Catmull introduced the idea of using the parameter values of parametrically defined surfaces to index into a texture definition function which scales the intensity of the reflected light. By tying the texture pattern to the parameter values, the texture is guaranteed to rotate and move with the object. This is good for showing patterns painted on the surface, but attempts to simulate rough surfaces in this way are unconvincing. This paper presents a method of using a texturing function to perform a small perturbation on the direction of the surface normal before using it in the intensity calculations. This process yields images with realistic looking surface wrinkles without the need to model each wrinkle as a separate surface element. Several samples of images made with this technique are included.},

We use vector descriptions of linear and areal features, with associated shaders to specify their appearance (terrain color and material), their footprint (effect on terrain shape), and their associated objects (bridges, hedges, etc.). In order to encompass both very large terrains and very fine details we rely on a view dependent quadtree re-finement scheme. New quads are generated when needed and cached on the GPU. For each quad we produce on the GPU an appearance texture, a footprint texture, and some object meshes, based on the features vector description and their associated shaders. Adaptive refinement, procedural vector features and a mipmap pyramid provide three LOD mechanisms for small, medium and large scale quads. Our results and attached video show high performance with high visual quality.},

abstract = {A recurrent problem in generating realistic pictures by computers is to represent natural irregular objects and phenomena without undue time or space overhead. We develop a new and powerful solution to this computer graphics problem by modeling objects as sample paths of stochastic processes. Of particular interest are those stochastic processes which previously have been found to be useful models of the natural phenomena to be represented. One such model applicable to the representation of terrains, known as “fractional Brownian motion,” has been developed by Mandelbrot. The value of a new approach to object modeling in computer graphics depends largely on the efficiency of the techniques used to implement the model. We introduce a new algorithm that computes a realistic, visually satisfactory approximation to fractional Brownian motion in faster time than with exact calculations. A major advantage of this technique is that it allows us to compute the surface to arbitrary levels of details without increasing the database. Thus objects with complex appearances can be displayed from a very small database. The character of the surface can be controlled by merely modifying a few parameters. A similar change allows complex motion to be created inexpensively.},

Current trends in digital terrain modelling are discussed. Topographical data sources and digital elevation model (DEM) interpolation and filtering methods are described in relation to the requirements of environmental models. Accurate representation of surface shape and drainage structure is a common requirement, and is facilitated by the development of locally-adaptive, process-based DEM interpolation techniques. The role of traditional contour data sources and remotely-sensed data sources is also examined. Methods for interpreting terrain include terrain parameters, as simplifications of key environmental processes, and a range of terrain features associated with secondary terrain structures. The issue of spatial scale is discussed in relation to the multi-scale requirements of environmental modelling and the identification of scaling properties of DEMs and associated terrain parameters. Multi-scale terrain feature analysis permits the incorporation of terrain structure into analyses of scale.},

abstract = {This paper describes the basis for techniques such as stochastic subdivision in the theory of random processes and estimation theory. The popular stochastic subdivision construction is then generalized to provide control of the autocorrelation and spectral properties of the synthesized random functions. The generalized construction is suitable for generating a variety of perceptually distinct high-quality random functions, including those with non-fractal spectra and directional or oscillatory characteristics. It is argued that a spectral modeling approach provides a more powerful and somewhat more intuitive perceptual characterization of random processes than does the fractal model. Synthetic textures and terrains are presented as a means of visually evaluating the generalized subdivision technique.},

abstract = {A solid noise is a function that deﬁnes a random value at each point in space. Solid noises have immediate and powerful applications in surface texturing, stochastic modeling, and the animation of natural phenomena. Existing solid noise synthesis algorithms are surveyed and two new algorithms are presented. The ﬁrst uses Wiener interpolation to interpolate random values on a discrete lattice. The second is an efﬁcient sparse convolution algorithm. Both algorithms are developed for model-directed synthesis, in which sampling and construction of the noise occur only at points where the noise value is required, rather than over a regularly sampled region of space. The paper attempts to present the rationale for the selection of these particular algorithms. The new algorithms have advantages of efﬁciency, improved control over the noise power spectrum, and the absence of artifacts. The convolution algorithm additionally allows quality to be traded for efﬁciency without introducing obvious deterministic effects. The algorithms are particularly suitable for applications where high-quality solid noises are required. Several sample applications in stochastic modeling and solid texturing are shown.},

We introduce the geometry clipmap, which caches the terrain in a set of nested regular grids centered about the viewer. The grids are stored as vertex buffers in fast video memory, and are incrementally refilled as the viewpoint moves. This simple framework provides visual continuity, uniform frame rate, complexity throttling, and graceful degradation. Moreover it allows two new exciting real-time functionalities: decompression and synthesis. Our main dataset is a 40GB height map of the United States. A compressed image pyramid reduces the size by a remarkable factor of 100, so that it fits entirely in memory. This compressed data also contributes normal maps for shading. As the viewer approaches the surface, we synthesize grid levels finer than the stored terrain using fractal noise displacement. Decompression, synthesis, and normal-map computations are incremental, thereby allowing interactive flight at 60 frames/sec.},

abstract = {This paper amplifies upon earlier theories and observations by the authors. advances a probabilistic model of rain fields, and exhibits realistic simulations, which the reader is advised to scan before continuing with the text. The model is also compared with other approaches. The theory of fractals has been in part motivated by the Hurst effect. which is an empirical observation in hydrology and climatology. A fractal is an unsmooth shape that is scaling, that is. where shape appears unchanged when examined by varying magnifications. The study of fractals is characterized by the prevalence of hyperbolically distributed random variables, for which Pr( Li {\textgreater} u) cc u “, where Pr is the probability that the value of the variable exceeds u, and a is a positive exponent. Lovejoy established the applicability of fractals in meteorology. by showing that cloud and rain areas project on the Earth along shapes whose boundaries are fractal curves, and that the temporal and spatial structure of rain is rife with hyperbolically distributed features. These observations, as amplified in this paper. set up the challenge of constructing fractal models with the observed properties. The models presented here belong to a very versatile family of random processes devised in Mandelbrot: fractal sums of (simple) pulses. or FSP processes. The simulations to be presented reveal that these processes involve a scaling heirarchy of “bands“. “fronts”. and “clusters”, as well as other complex shapes, none of which had been deliberately incorporated in the process. This very rich morphology and the related statistical distributions exemplify the power of simple fractal models to generate complex structures, and are in accord with the wide diversity of actual rainfall shapes. It is argued that this model already provides a useful context in which the basic statistical properties of the rainfield. including the relationship between the temporal and spatial structure. may be studied.},

abstract = {The extension of the concepts of Fractal Geometry (Mandelbrot [1983]) toward the life sciences has led to significant progress in understand- ing complex functional properties and architectural / morphological / struc- tural features characterising cells and tissues during ontogenesis and both normal and pathological development processes. It has even been argued that fractal geometry could provide a coherent description of the design principles underlying living organisms (Weibel [1991]). Fractals fulfil a certain number of theoretical and methodological criteria including a high level oforganization, shape irregularity, functional and morphological self-similar- ity, scale invariance, iterative pathways and a peculiar non-integer fractal dimension [FD]. Whereas mathematical objects are deterministic invariant or self-similar over an unlimited range of scales, biological components are statistically self-similar only within a fractal domain defined by upper and lower limits, called scaling window, in which the relationship between the scale of observation and the measured size or length of the object can be es- tablished (Losa and Nonnenmacher [1996]). Selected examples will contrib- ute to depict complex biological shapes and structures as fractal entities, and also to show why the application of the fractal principle is valuable for meas- uring dimensional, geometrical and functional parameters of cells, tissues and organs occurring within the vegetal and animal realms. If the criteria for a strict description of natural fractals are met, then it follows that a Fractal Geometry of Life may be envisaged and all natural objects and bio- logical systems exhibiting self-similar patterns and scaling properties may be considered as belonging to the new subdiscipline of “fractalomics”.},

abstract = {There are five fundamental concerns in the synthesis of realistic imagery of fractal landscapes: 1) convincing geometric models of terrain; 2) efficient algorithms for rendering those potentially-large terrain models; 3) atmospheric effects, or aerial perspective, to provide a sense of scale; 4) surface textures as models of natural phenomena such as clouds, water, rock strata, and so forth, to enhance visual detail in the image beyond what can be modelled geometrically; and 5) a global context in which to situate the scenes. Results in these five areas are presented, and some aspects of the development of computer graphics as a new process and medium for the fine arts are discussed. Heterogeneous terrain models are introduced, and preliminary experiments in simulating fluvial erosion are presented to provide fractal drainage network features. For imaging detailed terrain models we describe grid tracing, a time- and memory-efficient algorithm for ray tracing height fields. To obtain aerial perspective we develop geometric models of aerosol density distributions with efficient integration schemes for determining scattering and extinction, and an efficient Rayleigh scattering approximation. We also describe physically-based models of the rainbow and mirage. Proceduralism is an underlying theme of this work; this is the practice of abstracting models of complex form and behaviors into relatively terse algorithms, which are evaluated in a lazy fashion. Procedural textures are developed as models of natural phenomena such as mountains and clouds, culminating a procedural model of an Earth-like planet which in the future may be explored interactively in a virtual reality setting.},

abstract = {In standard fractal terrain models based on fractional Brownian motion the statistical character of the surface is, by design, the same everywhere. A new approach to the synthesis of fractal terrain height fields is presented which, in contrast to previous techniques, features locally independent control of the frequencies composing the surface, and thus local control of fractal dimension and other statistical characteristics. The new technique, termed noise synthesis, is intermediate in difficulty of implementation, between simple stochastic subdivision and Fourier filtering or generalized stochastic subdivision, and does not suffer the drawbacks of creases or periodicity. Varying the local crossover scale of fractal character or the fractal dimension with altitude or other functions yields more realistic first approximations to eroded landscapes. A simple physical erosion model is then suggested which simulates hydraulic and thermal erosion processes to create gloabl stream/valley networks and talus slopes. Finally, an efficient ray tracing algorithm for general height fields, of which most fractal terrains are a subset, is presented.},

abstract = {Digital surface representation from a set of three-dimensional samples is an important issue of computer graphics that has applications in different areas of study such as engineering, geology, geography, meteorology, medicine, etc. The digital model allows important information to be stored and analyzed without the necessity of working directly with the real surface. In addition, we can integrate products from digital terrain model (DTM) and other data in a geospatial information system (GIS) environment. The objective of this work is to model surfaces from a set of scattered three dimensional samples. The basic structure used to represent the surface is the triangulated irregular network (TIN). Another goal of the paper is evaluation of the quality of digital terrain models for representing spatial variation. This work presents stochastic methods for triangular surface fitting. One of the most popular stochastic models to represent curves and surfaces are based on fractal concept. A fractal is a geometrical or physical structure having an irregular or fragmented shape at all scales of measurement. In addition, a fractal is based on self-similarity concept indicating that each part of its structure is similar to the whole. Brownian motion is the most popular model used to perform fractal interpolations from a set of samples. The Fractional Brownian motion (FBM), derived from Brownian motion, can be used to simulate topographic surfaces. FBM provides a method of generating irregular, self-similar surfaces that resemble topography and that have a known fractional dimension. Fractal concept has been used for optimum sampling in generating a digital terrain model. Results of the research have shown that the method can be successfully used in DTM generation. In addition fractals allow us to create realistic surfaces in shorter time than with exact calculations. Another advantage of the fractal concept is the possibility of computing surfaces to arbitrary levels of detail without increasing size of the database.},

abstract = {Synthetically generated terrain models are useful across a broad range of applications, including computer generated art {\&} animation, virtual reality and gaming, and architecture. Existing algorithms for terrain generation suffer from a number of problems, especially that of being limited in the types of terrain that they can produce and of being difficult for the user to control. Typical applications of synthetic terrain have several factors in common: first, they require the generation of large regions of believable (though not necessarily physically correct) terrain features; and second, while real-time performance is often needed when visualizing the terrain, this is generally not the case when generating the terrain. In this thesis, I present a new, design-by-example method for synthesizing terrain height fields. In this approach, the user designs the layout of the terrain by sketching out simple regions using a CAD-style interface, and specifies the desired terrain characteristics of each region by providing example height fields displaying these characteristics (these height fields will typically come from real-world GIS data sources). A height field matching the user's design is generated at several levels of detail, using a genetic algorithm to blend together chunks of elevation data from the example height fields in a visually plausible manner. This method has the advantage of producing an unlimited diversity of reasonably realistic results, while requiring relatively little user effort and expertise. The guided randomization inherent in the genetic algorithm allows the algorithm to come up with novel arrangements of features, while still approximating user-specified constraints.},

There are several methods to generate fractal terrains, but none of those algorithms allow the user much flexibility in controlling the shape or properties of the final outcome. A few methods to modify fractal terrains have been previously proposed, both algorithm-based as well as by hand editing, but none of these provide a general solution. In this work, we present a new algorithm for fractal terrain deformation. We present a general solution that can be applied to a wide variety of deformations. Our approach employs stochastic local search to identify a sequence of local modifications, which deform the fractal terrain to conform to a set of specified constraints. The presented results show that the new method can incorporate multiple constraints simultaneously, while still preserving the natural look of the fractal terrain.},

abstract = {Stochastic modelling has been successfully used in computer graphics to model a wide array of natural phenomena. In modelling three-dimensional fuzzy or partially translucent phenomena, however, many approaches are hampered by high memory and computation requirements, and by a general lack of user control. The main contribution of this thesis is the introduction of a general stochastic modelling primitive that operates on two or more scales of visual detail. At the macroscopic level, the general shape of the model is constrained by an ellipsoidal correlation function that controls the in terpolation of user-supplied data values. A technique called Kriging is used to perform this in terpolation. The microscopic level permits the addition of noise, which allows one to add interesting visual textural detail and translucency. A wide variety of noise-synthesis techniques can be employed in our model. The main advantages of the model over existing ones are low storage requirements and the use of geometric primitives that are amenable to rendering in traditional environments. The basic theory of random fields, which underlies our model, and previous related mo dels in computer graphics are thoroughly reviewed. As a case study we apply our model to the simulation of clouds. The rendering algorithm developed takes full advantage of the separation of scales inherent in our model. Two alternative rendering algorithms will be described to render clouds. Possible extensions to more scales and applications to other phenomena are also discussed.},

Splines are easily constrained and well suited to modeling smooth, man-made objects. Fractals, while difficult to constrain, are suitable for generating various irregular shapes found in nature. This paper develops constrained fractals, a hybrid of splines and fractals which intimately combines their complementary features. This novel shape synthesis technique stems from a formal connection between fractals and generalized energy-minimizing splines which may be derived through Fourier analysis. A physical interpretation of constrained fractal generation is to drive a spline subject to constraints with modulated white noise, letting the spline diffuse the noise into the desired fractal spectrum as it settles into equilibrium. We use constrained fractals to synthesize realistic terrain models from sparse elevation data.},

Each topic involves the theory of multifractals. First, a summary of four known fractal-based techniques for terrain generation is presented including fractional Brownian motion, Mid-point displacement, Iterated Function Systems and the multifractal formalism. The multifractal formalism was chosen for both the analysis of realworld terrain data, as well as the generation of synthetic terrain surfaces. The authors implemented a multifractal terrain analysis algorithm that captures terrain characteristics of real-world data, into five parameters. These parameters were put into a multifractal terrain generation algorithm that produced synthetic terrain with features similar to those in the terrain that was analysed. Also, an algorithm for zooming in on synthetic terrain was developed. Finally, an application was developed that generates terrain dynamically. 1},

Our system emphasizes large-scale curvilinear features (ridges and valleys) because such features are the dominant visual elements in most terrains. Both the example height field and user's sketch map are analyzed using a technique from the field of geomorphology. The system finds patches from the example data that match the features found in the user's sketch. Patches are joined together using graph cuts and Poisson editing. The order in which patches are placed in the synthesized terrain is determined by breadth-first traversal of a feature tree and this generates improved results over standard raster-scan placement orders.
